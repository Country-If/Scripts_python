- Here are some Python scripts I wrote to help me with my work. I hope you find them useful too.

### git_push.py
- Information
```
1. This script is used to push a local git repository to a remote repository.
2. This script will continue to push the local repository to the remote repository until the push is successful.
```
- Requirements
```
pip install GitPython
```
- Usage
```
Right now, just copy the script to the local repository and run it.
In the future, I may encapsulate it into a class for convenience.
```
- Example
```
1. copy the script to the local repository that you want to push to the remote repository.
2. open a terminal and run the script: `python git_push.py`.
```
- TODO
```
1. Encapsulate into a class
2. Integrate with listary
```
